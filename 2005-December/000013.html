<PRE>Hello

For safety I live in a tent somewhere The relayer has this email address 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/nnw-cron">ameulen at unet.nl</A>

At that address my emails are copied into a new email and sent to the right 
email addresses.

It's winter outside the tent but inside it's cozy. It's a small backpackers 
tent.

I do a lot for the ERA promoting which I see as very important.

The attached 63rd NNW chronicle deals with independences in Squid. The user 
isn't a real boss of a squid demo. A squid demo is in the same way free 
from us as we are from others. You can only push him to do something. He 
will not always do what you wanted him to do. A squid can be disobeying as 
well. making errors en find new ways. Many Squids can differ by the genes 
and what history it has. That's not very different as we are. I will tell 
about that.

If members aren't interested anymore. Then could I delete you then? I will 
ask the members in this chronicle what their plans are. We aren't a project 
for sleepers.

So I expect a reply from the members. I know Ren&#233; is hosting NNW. That is a 
splendid job. I will talk also about how to upload docs for Ren&#233;.

Please have a nice Chrismas and a happy new year,

ed
