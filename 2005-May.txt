Subject: [Nnw-cron] The 56th NNW Chronicle, from May 2005
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050515125357.02407b78@pop.unet.nl>

Hi

So good people, here we go...

Please send me a oneliner email, when you don't want these emails. 
Otherwise please send we an email that you are still alive. A one-liner 
email isn't so much.

The 56th NNW chronicle is ready for you. It contains what we do in NNW and 
other things.

I hope you can appreciate it.

I tell about the scientists, on which we are building and which we honor in 
our way. Like the once so famous mathematician, scientists and philosopher 
Henri Jules Poincar?. We are using a paper from him from 1899. Some 4 years 
later he came with the 3-body problem. But before he met a more physical 
way. And that was a right one.

When other people are jumping on riding trains. Do they know where they are 
heading for? Does someone look back how it began? Why would we do the same. 
We have also senses and an own brain.

Please have a splendid time
