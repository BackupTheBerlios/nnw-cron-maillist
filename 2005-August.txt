Hi,

How are you?

A new NNW-chronicle with how I do the promoting for NNW, a big job. 
Otherwise other people will drown us. So we have to make some noise. I give 
you a short description how I work on that.

And further not the Poincar? finding from 1899. We have talked about that. 
But now the famous Poincar? conjecture from 1904. Some people will like that.

I have got feedback about my styles of writing and now I now we have also 
in this project. different target groups. And elsewhere as well. Not 
everybody likes what I like. And that is normal.

Please have a nice day

ed
