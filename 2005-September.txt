Subject: [Nnw-cron] The brand new 60th NNW Chronicle
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050915124542.017816c8@pop.unet.nl>

Hi,

How are you?

Still alive. Still breathing.

A new NNW chronicle about screen shots. About that we see shifting 
everywhere. Our feet over the floor. Birds shift in the air. A molecule 
shifts to another molecule and we can see a chemical reaction. Everyweher 
we can see shifting. And in the sources of NNW we are only shifting. We are 
typical making simulation tools. Other people make analyzing tools and we 
have to work together.

I hope you can like the 60-th NNW chronicle. Old ones on the site to see.

Please have nice day

ed
