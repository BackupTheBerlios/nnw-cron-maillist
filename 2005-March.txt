Hi,

How are you?

I have written a lot papers about mathematics of the 21st century and a 
major work. All chronicles to see on sites as well. Also quite some work.

In this way we can promote the members who are active as well. Their names 
are in the keyword list. And they are mentioned in connection with maybe 
interesting other things.

We can now also easily refer to the chronicles. We have access to them now.

So enough to do at this side also for promoting what we are doing.

I hope you live well,

ed
