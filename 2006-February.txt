Hi

How are you?

I bring you news about the third demo Squid. Two new fantastic NNW members. 
I have to update the todo list for Squid. That comes. News about the 
Daughter project NNW-NP as well. We work on a great tryout module, typical 
in the NNW way with LODs, levels of details, and the physical connection 
between them. A very nice project as well.

And I will talk about big projects, small projects and about our projects.

And how do you do?

Please have a nice day, with your favorite drink.
