Subject: [Nnw-cron] The brand new 60th NNW Chronicle
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20051015122645.02717878@pop.unet.nl>

Hi,

How are you?

The sun shines here.

In the new 61st Chronicle I will talk about that odd phenomenon that stupid 
neuron or cell we have. So marvelous interacting with the modules. The cell 
is just a C-struct. Not so special. But with strange features. Functioning 
can destroy a cell and the information in it can grow.

I will talk about what we do further.

I hope you can like the 61-st NNW chronicle. And that you can find some 
time for it. I have done my best for you. Old chronicles are on the site to 
admire, grin.

Please have nice day

ed
