Hi

So good people,

The 55th NNW chronicle is ready for you. It contains what we do in NNW and 
other things.

I hope you can appreciate this. Much has happened. And in this chronicle I 
will tell you that.

When you haven't done it you are also invited to subscribe to mailing list 
of these projects. All on the same true basis.

This is a way to subscribe

All old chronicles are now already available for everybody. Just click this 
link and a column we see for the chronicles. It's the left column. Also in 
our keyword search tool we can find subjects in the chronicles.

http://nnw.berlios.de/docs.php/by-date

Starting with the first members, we are writing together history. Of course 
the first members will become famous in this world. We promote everybody 
who is also active for us. And we are standing in the truth.

Please have a very nice time

ed
